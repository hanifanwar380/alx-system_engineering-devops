# Description
Adding a load balancer configured as a cluster with the previous one. Also having the previous server components being split into their own servers.

Specifics About This Infrastructure
This infrastructue basically breaks down each component in each server to independent unit. Which eliminates a single point of failure, as the load balancers can direct traffic accordingly without the need for a downtime. Also maintenance actions can occur without any downtime on the website. Overall, there is added security on all layers and levels of the internal network and external traffic. With monitoring, more data collection points and metrics are available to the admin, which will also help to improve and maintain network performance, along with zero downtime.
